# Statistical analysis of Dataset
The link between Covid-19 and the percentage of deaths among both smokers and non-smokers.
# Project Description
We have used a huge dataset of all states and counties present in the United States Of America to decide once and for all,
whether there is a concrete link that proves that smokers are indeed more likely to die if they do catch Covid-19.
We will use multiple statistics from the dataset on hand by parsing them and seeing if any correlations arise,
and then we will finally decide based solely on the statistics found whether there is indeed a danger of being a smoker during the pandemic.

 # Conclusion
 While all the data currently suggests no correlation between smoking and an increased chance of dying due to Covid-19,
 things may very well change and with more precise and accurate data,
 we may be able to find a link between an increased percentage of deaths due to Covid-19 within the smoking population.
